# Unity Bomberman

Game is completely functional but only has two levels

## Things that could be fixed / improved if so desired later on 

1. Add in pause screen to allow going back to main menu/quitting game from within a level
2. Animation to enemy deaths (using spritesheets like when boxes blowup)
3. Player health, player health display, player damage, etc
4. More levels
5. Boss fight(s)
6. Maybe some larger maps that require moving camera
